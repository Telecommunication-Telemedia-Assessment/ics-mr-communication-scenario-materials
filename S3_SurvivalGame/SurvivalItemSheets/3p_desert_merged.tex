    \Large You have just crash-landed in the Sonora desert in the south-west of United States. The pilot and copilot have been killed in the crash. However, the pilot announced that before impact you were approximately 110 km off the course of the flight plan. He also indicated that that you were 113 km southwest of a mining camp which is the nearest known habitation. The surrounding desert is made up of sand dunes and seems dry except for some cactus. The last weather report indicated that the temperature at the ground level will be about 45°C. All of you are dressed in light clothes – cotton shirts, trousers, socks, and soft shoes. 

Before the crash, your group was able to save some items.\clearpage
