    \Large You have just crash-landed in the North of Canada. The small plane in which you were travelling has been completely destroyed except for the frame. The pilot and co-pilot have been killed, but no one else is seriously injured.
You are in a wilderness area, snow-covered and made up of thick woods broken by many lakes and rivers. The pilot announced shortly before the crash that you were eighty miles northwest of a small town that is the nearest known habitation. It is mid-January. The last weather report indicated that the temperature would reach minus twenty-five degrees in the daytime and minus forty at night. You are dressed in winter clothing appropriate for city wear – suits, pantsuits, street shoes, and overcoats. While escaping from the plane, your group salvaged a few items.
