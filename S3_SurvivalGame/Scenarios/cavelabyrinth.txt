You were on a tour through a large cave labyrinth with underground lakes for several days now. A tunnel crashed down, you and two fellow travelers were separated from the tour guide and the rest of the group. You also lost all possibilities to contact the others. Fortunately no one is injured and your protective clothes and helmet lamps are in good condition. The evening before, the tour guide explained that there are several exits from the cave, but it takes several days to reach those and one needs to cross some of the underground lakes. On your side of the collapsed tunnel you could find some items.
