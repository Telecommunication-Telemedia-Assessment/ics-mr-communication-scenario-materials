On a boat expedition on the Amazonas, there was an explosion in the boat's engine room in the early morning. Engine and controls are totally destroyed and there is a significant leak in the hull. Fortunately the boat was quickly taken ashore overnight and nobody was injured, as the cabins were at the end of the boat away from the engine room. You are in an inhabited area of the Amazonas, you past by the last village 1.5 days ago. You are wearing appropriate clothing for the jungle and it is rainy season. Most of the equipment was thrown overboard, but you could find some items.
